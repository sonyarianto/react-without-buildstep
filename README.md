Why? Why not. This skeleton project is dedicated to:
-  CDN fans around the world.
-  jQuery lovers around the world but want to use React the way like using jQuery.
-  People that want to see and how to use React without any build steps.
-  People that hate `npm install` things.
-  People that hate build steps.
-  People that want to learn React from different perspective and angle.
-  People that interested to extend this simple code.
-  Myself, that want to have documentation about using React with CDN.

## Installation
No, there is no installation.

## Where is the `npm install` things?
No, there is no `npm install` things.

## Then how to run?
Just run using your favorite static web server. My favorite is `php -S 0.0.0.0:3000` on current repo directory, buahahaha. Errrr you know better lah. In this repository there is file called `index.html`. Yes, that's it. That's the code that contains the HTML, JS (React code, router etc) and no CSS (just standard styling).

## What's included on this skeleton project
- Simple SPA (Single Page Application) website with React (React and React DOM).
- Using Router, React Router and React Router DOM (all CDN version).
- Using Babel standalone version (CDN). I know standalone is not for production, but hey relaxxx bro.
- Simple two page components (Home and About) and a header component (Header) to represent the component things.
